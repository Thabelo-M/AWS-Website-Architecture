# AWS-Website-Architecture
Designing an AWS architecture for a website application that will be used worldwide.

This architecture is designed for a new website application that will serve thousands of users worldwide. The website needs to handle high traffic volumes, ensure fast and reliable performance, and maintain strict security standards.  The website architecture must be scalable, cost-effective, and resilient. The application must be available 24/7 with minimal downtime, and the architecture should scale seamlessly to accommodate increasing user demand. Users should experience fast page load times and smooth browsing experiences, while the application adheres to industry best practices for security, including encryption, access controls, and protection against common threats. Additionally, the architecture should be cost-effective, with efficient resource utilization and minimal wastage. When designing the architecture, I had to consider factors such as redundancy, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery to ensure the platform's reliability and availability.
